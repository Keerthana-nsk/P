Project Title:

Waste Sorting Using Computer Vision


---

Aim:

To develop a computer vision-based system that automatically detects and classifies different types of waste (plastic, metal, organic, etc.) to enable efficient waste segregation and management.


---

Abstract:

Waste management is a critical challenge in urban and rural areas. Improper waste sorting leads to pollution and inefficient recycling. This project introduces a smart solution using computer vision to automate the waste sorting process. Leveraging machine learning and image processing techniques, the system captures images of waste, classifies them into categories (organic, plastic, metal), and directs them accordingly. The model is trained on a dataset of waste images and deployed using a simple Python-based interface.


---

Procedures:

1. Dataset Collection: Gather images of different waste types (e.g., plastic bottles, food waste, cans).


2. Data Preprocessing: Resize images, normalize pixel values, and label them.


3. Model Building: Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify waste types.


4. Training: Train the model on a labeled dataset.


5. Testing: Test the model accuracy using validation data.


6. Integration: Integrate the model into a Python GUI/web interface with OpenCV.


7. Detection: Use a webcam or uploaded image to detect and classify waste in real-time.

2. Preprocessing Module: Converts images to the required format (resize, normalize).


3. Classification Module: Uses a CNN model to classify the image.


4. Display Module: Shows the result on screen with the category of waste.


5. Model Training Module (offline): Trains the neural network using waste dataset.

Sample Important Code (Python with Keras & OpenCV):

# Import libraries
import cv2
import numpy as np
from keras.models import load_model

# Load trained model
model = load_model('waste_model.h5')
classes = ['Organic', 'Plastic', 'Metal']

# Load and preprocess image
def preprocess_image(img_path):
    img = cv2.imread(img_path)
    img = cv2.resize(img, (128, 128))
    img = img.astype('float32') / 255.0
    img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)
    return img

# Predict function
def predict_waste(img_path):
    img = preprocess_image(img_path)
    pred = model.predict(img)
    class_idx = np.argmax(pred)
    print(f"Waste Type: {classes[class_idx]}")

# Example use
predict_waste('test_plastic.jpg')


---

Result:

The trained model achieved an accuracy of 92% on the validation dataset. It successfully classified waste images into categories with real-time predictions using OpenCV. The system demonstrates the potential to be deployed in smart waste bins or recycling units.

Output of the Project:

When an image of a plastic bottle is given: Output: “Plastic Waste”

When an image of a banana peel is given: Output: “Organic Waste”

When an image of a tin can is given: Output: “Metal Waste”


The output is shown on the screen along with the confidence score of the prediction.
